# FBLA 2021-2022 Coding and Programming

## Topic

You have been hired by your state or local areaâ€™s tourism bureau to develop a program that suggests attractions(can be tourist attractions, restaurants, shopping, things to do, etc.)to potential visitors. Your program will allowusers to search for attractions in the area based on desired attributes, such as location, type of attraction, andamenities. Your program must include at least 50 attractions, and users must be able to define at least five desiredattributes to searchfor an attraction.

## Overview

This application suggests attractions in Philadelphia to users. Users can search based on the setting, cost, area of Philadelphia, type of attraction, days of the week, and whether the attraction has food. Additionally, the user can search the attraction by name. The application will display all of the attractions that meet the criteria with their respective addresses. Furthermore, users can check the box within a certain attraction if they have visited that place before, so they can keep track of where they've been. The list of attractions is expandable so that more can be added in the future.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javscript. The structure of the visual website is layed out in "index.html". Most of the styling is put into "style.css" while some is kept inline inside the HTML because putting it into the css file was not necessary. The functionality, which includes searching, filtering, and changing the list of displayed attractions, is handled by the file "script.js".

To run the application, go to the repository main page and find the green code button. Then, download it as a zip file. Next, copy the unzipped folder that should be titled "FBLA_2021-22-main". Lastly, go into the folder and run "index.html" in your preferred browser.
